# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a Database analysis for Pewlett Hackard, a large company, for the upcoming “Silver Tsunami”. A large number of employees are expected to begin retiring. By completing this analysis, the company will identify the number of retiring employees by titles(positions) and determine which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. This will help Pewlett Hackard to prepare a plan to hire new staff and prepare for a mentorship initiative.  
-A query is written and executed to create a Retirement Titles table for employees who are born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955.
